Khoj has been deployed to your cluster.

1.  **Configure DNS:**
    If you are not using a public DNS provider, you must add an entry to your local `/etc/hosts` file to access the Khoj UI:
    192.168.0.142 {{.Values.ingress.host }}

2.  **Access the application:**
    You can now access the Khoj web UI by navigating to:
    http://{{.Values.ingress.host }}

3.  **Check Pod Status:**
    To check the status of all deployed components, run:
    kubectl get pods -n {{.Release.Namespace }}
